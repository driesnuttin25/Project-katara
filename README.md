Here are a couple topics I should talk about in my application note:
- Electronics layout
- Pcb layout
- Why I did this project
- 2 possible usages (Personal plant grower or batch plant grower)
- Bluetooth and connectivity
- Case design
- Power limitations regarding LEDS (should have allowed for more wattage and used a heat sink for the mosfet)
- Light spectrums (Which light should be used for plant grow?) [Youtube explanation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUpEQ4kU148&ab_channel=AlboPepper-DroughtProofUrbanGardening)
- Talk about chemical processes required for feeding the plant
- Possible experiments and proof of concepts
